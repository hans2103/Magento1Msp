To prevent multiple clicks to "Place Order" button in checkout Magento file must be modifed (not plugin file).

Locate line 77 (Magento version 1.4.2) in file skin/frontend/base/default/js/opcheckout.js

Change:
if (this.loadWaiting) {

To:
if (this.loadWaiting && (this.loadWaiting != "review")) {

NOTE: To see the patch working javascript file must be reloaded. Often browser takes unmodifed opcheckout.js file from cache which does not affect button behavior.
